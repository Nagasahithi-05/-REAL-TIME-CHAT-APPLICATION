**Description:
A real-time chat application is a communication platform that enables users to exchange messages instantly over the internet. It can be used for one-on-one conversations, group chats, or even integrated into customer support systems and gaming platforms. 
This project involves the development of a web-based or mobile chat application that allows users to communicate in real time. The system ensures instantaneous message delivery, real-time updates without requiring manual refresh, and seamless user experience across devices.
Core Features:
- User Authentication: Secure login/signup system with options for username/password, email verification, or social media integration.
- Instant Messaging: Real-time one-on-one and group chats using WebSockets or similar technologies to ensure low-latency message delivery.
- Online Presence Indicator: Shows active/idle status of users.
- Media Sharing: Support for sending images, emojis, files, and perhaps voice messages.
- Chat History: Persistent message storage using databases (like MongoDB or Firebase), with options to view past conversations.
- Typing Indicators & Read Receipts: Feedback to users about conversation activity.
